      <div class="letter-text">
        I don’t even know where to start because whenever I think about you, my heart just feels too full. You are the kind of person people search their whole lives for. Your heart is so gentle, so caring, so genuine — and I promise you, as long as I breathe, I will protect that heart. The world can be loud and unfair sometimes, but you will never face it alone. I’m always beside you.
        <br><br>
        I admire the way you love. The way you give your all to everything — your studies, your dreams, the people around you. You don’t just do things halfway. You put your whole soul into it. That’s what makes you different. That’s what makes you you.
        <br><br>
        And today… I need you to really hear this — I am so incredibly proud of you. Congratulations on your Nursing Cupping and Pinning, my future RN 🤍 That moment isn’t just a ceremony. It’s proof of your hard work, your sacrifices, your sleepless nights, your strength. You earned every bit of it. Watching you grow into the nurse you’re becoming makes me feel lucky to witness your journey up close.
        <br><br>
        You were made for this path. The way you care, the way you comfort, the way you naturally want to help — it’s not something that can be taught. It’s who you are. And one day, so many patients will feel safe just because you’re in the room.
        <br><br>
        I think about how life brought us and it makes me happy. We are in a world, with a lot of people but I found you. You are my Dea. You are the one who makes me feel peaceful. You are my happiness. You are the place where I feel safe. When you smile it makes my bad days better. You do not even have to try. Your smile is enough to fix my days.
        <br><br>
        This Valentine’s Day isn’t just about love to me — it’s about celebrating you. The woman who completely took over my heart without even trying. I am so proud of everything you are and everything you’re becoming. Sometimes I just sit and think about you and smile like an idiot because I can’t believe you’re mine.
        <br><br>
        I’m not just in love with you… I’m obsessed with you. With your voice. Your laugh. Your little expressions. The way you talk when you’re excited. The way you care so deeply. You live in my head rent-free 24/7 and I don’t even want you to leave.
        <br><br>
        I believe in you more than you know. I see your strength even when you don’t. And I swear, watching you grow and shine makes me fall for you all over again. Every single year, every single day — I’m choosing you.
        <br><br>
        And I’ll keep choosing you. Always ❤️
